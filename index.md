# Gesture Controlled Robot
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# First Milestone: Building the chassis of the robot and making it move how I want it to.

There have been many obstacles during my experience with BlueStamp and this project. When I first started this project, I had no prior experience with Arduino (The coding software which uses a modified C++ language), wiring and using micro controllers, and integration of different mediums/chips to accomplish the same goal. The first step to this project was building the chassis of the robot. This was the simplest step. The second step for this milestone was completely wiring the motors to the H-bridges to a BreadBoard which finally connects to the Uno. I took the attaced wires from motors of the robot and connected them to the H-bridges, which acts as a port for all the wires, which receives power from the Arduino Uno chip through a BreadBoard. The BreadBoard also connects the motor wires to the input pins in the Arduino Uno chip. Once the wiring was completed, I made a program in Arduino to make the car move in different directions. To do this, you need to define the input pins as the motors they are attached through and command them to move clockwise or counter-clockwise by calling it either HIGH or LOW. The alternation of these callings can make the robot move forward, backward, left, or right. Lastly, the main challenges I ran into for this milestone were learning how to code in Arduino, understanding the concepts of wiring, and de-bugging my program and wiring. 

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
